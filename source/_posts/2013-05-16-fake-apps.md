title: Fake apps on Windows App Store
---

It has come to our attention that there are several fake apps on the Windows App Store
that use our program's name.

We are not publishing MPC-HC on Windows App Store yet, so any programs you find there
should be considered **fake** and should be **reported** as they violate the license.

Don't forget, that our official builds, both the stable and the beta builds,
[are digitally signed](/2013/02/25/binaries-are-signed/).
