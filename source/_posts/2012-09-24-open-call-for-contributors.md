We are always in need of people willing to help us make MPC-HC better.

We are mostly looking for:

- C++ developers
- designers to create logos for the player or images for the file associations
- web developers to maintain the main website

If you want to help, please join our [IRC channel](/contact-us) and talk to us.
Any help is always appreciated so don't hesitate.
