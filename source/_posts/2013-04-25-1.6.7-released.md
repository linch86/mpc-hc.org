title: v1.6.7 is released
---
After almost 1 and a half months since the last stable build, we decided to release 1.6.7.

This release is mainly a bugfix release. It also has a big performance improvement
when using an INI file to store the settings.

You can download the new version [here](/downloads/).
For the complete changes see the [changelog](/changelog/).
