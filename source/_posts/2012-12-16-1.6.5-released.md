title: v1.6.5 is released
---

After 2 and a half months since the last stable build, we decided to release 1.6.5.
This release has many bugfixes and a few new features.

Highlights of this release:

* Some long standing issues for the Internal Subtitle Renderer/VSFilter have been fixed:
    * Support UTF-8 subtitles without BOM
    * Fix high memory usage with complex subtitles (mostly ASS)
    * Fix most cases where subtitles are not correctly positioned
    * Allow floating-point values for `\fscx` and `\fscy` in ASS subtitles
* Windows 8 is now officially supported and the file association problem has been solved. Windows 8 users should click the "Set Default Programs" button after selecting new formats.
* The DVB support has been improved with a better handling of DVB subtitles and a clearer display of the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) information when using live capture.
