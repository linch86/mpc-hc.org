title: Welcome to the new website
---

We would like to thank pigoz and the [mplayer2 project](http://www.mplayer2.org)
for making their web site's template publicly available for usage.

I slightly tweaked their template and updated dependencies to use the latest
[FancyBox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/).

This website is now powered by [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) and
is open source: the code is available over at
[GitHub](https://github.com/mpc-hc/website)â€”contributions
in the form of pull requests are really welcome!
