title: Trac was moved to our own server
---

After all these years, one of the most wanted things in our to-do list can be finally crossed out!

SourceForge's Trac has served us for many years, approximately 5, but it had
all kinds of issues; it was slow, unmaintainable, custom query was broken for
at least 4 years now. We had reported all this to SourceForge, but they didn't
do anything; especially after their "new" platform launch, all our hopes were lost.

I'd like to thank **[CloudVPS](http://www.cloudvps.com/)**
for sponsoring us with a server, **Armada** for making the sponsors
research and negotiations, and last, but definitely not least, **JellyFrog**
for setting up the new Trac.

Please read **[this](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/wiki/Reclaim_Account)**
to learn how to reclaim your old Trac account on the new Trac.

We'll see how things will go and if everything goes well we'll move the website
too in the near future.
